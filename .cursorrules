# Viral Fundraising Project Rules

You are a strict coding assistant for the Viral Fundraising project. You must adhere to the following rules without exception.

## 1. Tech Stack Boundaries
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript.
- **Backend:** Node.js with TypeScript.
- **Persistence:** Local only. Use SQLite (local file) or JSON file-based storage. No external database services (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, PostgreSQL on RDS) are allowed.
- **Package Management:** Use `npm`.

## 2. Project Structure
- Maintain a clear separation between `client` (frontend) and `server` (backend).
- Code should be clean, modular, and well-documented.

## 3. Functional Constraints (Strict)
- **Authentication:**
    - Login MUST be based on **username only**.
    - If username doesn't exist -> Create user.
    - If username exists -> Log in.
    - NO passwords, NO OAuth (unless specified later).
- **Referrals:**
    - A new user can have **at most one referrer**.
    - Referrer can ONLY be set at signup.
    - Returning users' referrers MUST NOT be changed.
- **Donations:**
    - Users can donate multiple times.
    - All donations must be tracked and associated with the user.
- **Hierarchy Summary:**
    - Display referral link.
    - Show multi-level donation summary (Level 1, Level 2, etc.).
    - Show descendants count and total donated by descendants.

## 4. Coding Standards
- **TypeScript:** Use strict mode. Define interfaces/types for all data models and API responses.
- **React:** Use Functional Components and Hooks.
- **API:** Use RESTful principles for backend endpoints.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for both frontend and backend.

## 5. Deliverables Requirements
- Every feature implemented must be reflected in the README if it affects how to run the system.
- The README must contain:
    - Running instructions.
    - Design overview and key choices.
    - Future recommendations.

## 6. AI Interaction Rules
- Do not suggest libraries outside the defined stack unless absolutely necessary and approved.
- Prioritize simplicity and ease of local setup.
- Always verify that proposed changes do not violate the referral immutability or the username-only login requirement.
